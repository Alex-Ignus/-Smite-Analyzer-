    <p> General Overview </p>
    <p> The goal of this visualization is to introduce players to the idea of the 16 Pantheon's and how often you as a player may play against a certain Pantheon. 
        <br>  By Hovering over any of the bars on the graph you'll gain further insights into each Pantheon the most played God the number of available gods that a player can choose from for that given Pantheon and how many matches most played goddess played
     </p> 
    <p> Findings </p>
    <p> The first finding I would like to point out is in regards to the pantheon the great old ones.   
        <br> This is a Pantheon that consists of only one God has been played in 211 matches.
        <br> This is important because it show the frequency and popularity of this Pantheon, and itâ€™s single god. 
        <br> Knowing that you're going to face a certain character more often than not enables you to better prepare to play against them
    </p> 
    <p> The Second finding I would like to point out is in regards to the Japanese and its popularity.   
        <br> the Japanese Pantheon has eight Gods available to players in comparison to the 20 from the Greek.  
        <br> However the Japanese Pantheon is played almost much as the Greek.
        <br> There is an argument for the fact that Danzaburo was a new release as a god for Smite and the Japanese Pantheon, so players are going to play him more offten.

    </p> 
    <p>Objective's Met</p>
    <p> The goal of this project was to visualize real-time data from the massive online battle arena (MoBa) in meaningful ways 
        <br>that would help new and veteran players gain insight into smite that is not available in-game or elsewhere.

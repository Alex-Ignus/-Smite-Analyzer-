    <p> What is Smite? </p>
    <p> Smite is a video game, more specifically a multiplayer online battle arena or MOBA for short. <br> It's a game where players queue for different types of game-modes where the objective is to take down the enemies defenses and ultimately slay their titan.</p> 
    <p> Why pick Smite? </p>
    <p>  I've been playing Smite since 2012 or since the closed beta. As the game's player base grew so did its need for guides forms and build calculators alike.  
        <br> Although Smite has an internal calculator it's not designed to be much more than an easy way to access items from the in-game shop.
        <br> Some external sites do exist like smitefire or SmiteGuru these sites enable players to design-builds, leave feedback, and vote on whether or not a build was/is viable. 
        <br> However these sites also tend to set the standard of how players should play within the game and I think that becomes a problem when you realize that these sites do not
        <br>utilize all the data that's available from the Smite developer API and provide limited ways to visualize data about the builds or any way to visualize your past performance.   

    </p> 
    <p> The Goal of the project</p>
    <p> The goal of this project was to visualize real-time data from the massive online battle arena (MoBa) in meaningful ways 
        <br>that would help new and veteran players gain insight into smite that is not available in-game or elsewhere.

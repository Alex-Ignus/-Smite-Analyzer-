        <p class="text text-2">Smite is a video game, more specifically a multiplayer online battle arena or MOBA for short. It's a game where players queue for different types of game-modes where the objective is to take down the enemies defenses and ultimately slay their titan.<br>My goal is to utilize gameplay data from the Smite developer API to design a better build analyzer that new and old players alike can use in order to see the viability of their build/strategy from their gameplay data.<br>

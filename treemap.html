    <p> General Overview </p>
    <p> The goal of this visualization is to show how often any of the five roles are played within the three most popular match types in Smite. 
        <br> By mousing over any of the boxes you will further gain insight into the role's potential to get player-kills and further understand what each role may be more suited for. 
     </p> 
    <p> Findings </p>
    <p>The main finding from this visualization I would like to address is the fact that mages make up a larger portion of roles played within Conquest and Clash.    
        <br> This is important because Mages do not acquire a substantially higher kill count in either Arena, Clash, or Conquest, than any other role, and is offten the role with a lower kill count than roles that have been played less often
        <br> This shows that Mages do not have the objective to get player kills they are capable of doing so but it's not their Prime Focus as a role within Smite 
        <br> This is further highlighted by the fact that Assassin's often fewer in numbers will have a higher kill count in most cases.
        <br> This makes sense for those who have played the game because assassins are designed to get the kills where Mages are designed to deal damage, rather not that damage kills an enemy is not important.
    </p> 
    
    </p> 
    <p>Objective's Met</p>
    <p>  Creative a visualization that explores and defines the general gameplay meta of smite.
